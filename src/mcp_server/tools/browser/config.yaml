# Environment variable configuration:
#   CHROME_DRIVER_PATH  - Path to chromedriver executable (bypasses auto-download)
#   EDGE_DRIVER_PATH    - Path to msedgedriver executable (bypasses auto-download)
#   HTTPS_PROXY         - Proxy for driver download (respected by Selenium Manager)
#
# If Chrome driver creation fails (e.g., network issue), Edge is used as auto-fallback.
